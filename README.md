# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:

Analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and reviews written by unpaid members. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review

## Summary

In the Vine program, 51 percent of the reviews are paid for 5 star reviews and 39 percent were non-Vine reviews.  This means that we are not receiving
quality reviews as 51 percent are paid so there is a bias in reviews.  Maybe we could create a regression to see if there is any relationships between 5 star reviews for paid and unpaid reviewers.
